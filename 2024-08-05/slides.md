In my previous job, I worked on 3D modeling visualization, where optimizing model size was essential. I used Draco for compression but didn't understand how it works.

Recently, I read papers on Point Cloud Compression and found out that Draco is one of these methods. 

By applying this project, I want to learn the principles behind it and apply this knowledge in engineering practice.

<!--
If I am accepted into this fellowship, here is my timeline and plan:

From August to October 2024, I will conduct a literature review and initial research, which is currently ongoing.

From November 2024 to February 2025, I will focus on setting up experiments and collecting data.

Between March and May 2025, I will be analyzing and interpreting the data collected.

From June to July 2025, I will be drafting the research paper and preparing the results for presentation

Finally, in August 2025, I will conduct a final review and submit the completed research.
